# Runway Scheduling: GA vs ILP

This project compares **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** for solving a **runway scheduling optimization problem**.  
The goal is to schedule aircraft arrivals and departures while respecting minimum separation constraints, minimizing delays, and prioritizing important flights.

---

## üìå Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates randomized arrival/departure scenarios.
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**:
  - Multi-objective optimization (delay + priority penalty).
  - Uses stochastic delays to simulate real-world uncertainties.
- **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**:
  - Deterministic optimization of scheduling with separation constraints.
  - Solves using MATLAB‚Äôs `intlinprog`.
- **Performance Analysis**:
  - Runtime comparison of GA vs ILP.
  - Objective value comparison of GA vs ILP.
  - Visualization of scaling with increasing aircraft.

## üìä Results Summary
- **Runtime Scaling**:
  - GA scales more smoothly with increasing aircraft.
  - ILP runtime grows much faster, becoming computationally expensive for larger instances.
- **Objective Value**:
  - GA provides better (lower) average objective values.
  - ILP yields higher values as it optimizes deterministically without stochastic handling.
